# Equipment basics

The exercises that make up this mini-course in sensors for journalism will use three basic toolsets: the Arduino, the Spark Core/Photon and the Raspberry Pi. For each, you'll need a few basics. We do not receive compensation for any of the links below. They are here for reference purpose -- you are free to purchase where you please. 

**More complete list to come.**

## Sensors/miscellaneous


* Breadboard jumper wires
* Random LEDs. Color or size doesn't matter
* A breadboard
* An RHT03 temperature and humidity sensor
* A ChronoDot v2.1
* An [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps) board
* A u.FL connector for a GPS antenna

## Arduino

* An Arduino or Arduino compatible board.
* [The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


## Spark Core

* A Spark Core or Spark Electron board
* A web browser 


## Raspberry Pi

* A Raspberry Pi (model doesn't matter)
* [A Raspberry Pi Cobbler](https://www.adafruit.com/products/914) or [Pi Wedge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13717)
* A USB mouse
* A USB keyboard
* A computer monitor with HDMI inputs
* A power cord

Once you get your RasPi up and running, you'll need to install the Rpi-GPIO library into python. You do that by running this on a terminal:

```sudo apt-get install python-dev python-rpi.gpio```
