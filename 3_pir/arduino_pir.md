# Detecting motion

### Sensing something visible

Journalism is about people, right? So let's figure out a way to detect a person in the room and then do something. 

## Arduino

**STEP 1**

Gather your materials. You will need your Arduino, passive infrared sensor, and three jumper wires (red, yellow and black).  

**STEP 2** 

<!--Maybe use pin numbers instead?-->
Lay the Arduino so you can read the input labels. Find one GND (Ground) input and the 5V (five volt) on the left column of inputs. Find the _TX -> 1_ on the right column of inputs.

Find the VCC, GND and OUT ports on the passive infrared sensor.
  

**STEP 3** 

<!--Maybe use pin numbers instead?-->

Usually, black jumper wires are for grounding. Plug one end of your black jumper into the GND port on the passive infrared sensor, and plug the other end into the GND port on the left column of inputs on your Arduino. 

Usually, red jumper wires are for power. Plug one end of your red jumper into the VCC port on the passive infrared sensor, and plug the other end into the 5V input on the left column of inputs on your Arduino.

Usually, yellow jumper wires are for everything else. Plug one end of your yellow jumper into the OUT port on the passive infrared sensor, and plug the other end into the _TX -> 1_ input on the right column of inputs on your Arduino.  

**STEP 4** 

Open your Arduino IDE. Plug your Arduino into your computer. Verify and upload this code:

```
/*
 * PIR sensor tester
 */
 
int ledPin = 13;                // choose the pin for the LED
int inputPin = 2;               // choose the input pin (for PIR sensor)
int pirState = LOW;             // we start, assuming no motion detected
int val = 0;                    // variable for reading the pin status
 
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // declare LED as output
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // declare sensor as input
 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
 
void loop(){
  val = digitalRead(inputPin);  // read input value
  if (val == HIGH) {            // check if the input is HIGH
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
    if (pirState == LOW) {
      // we have just turned on
      Serial.println("Motion detected!");
      // We only want to print on the output change, not state
      pirState = HIGH;
    }
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turn LED OFF
    if (pirState == HIGH){
      // we have just turned of
      Serial.println("Motion ended!");
      // We only want to print on the output change, not state
      pirState = LOW;
    }
  }
}
```
 
**STEP 5** 

If all goes well, the passive infrared sensor should light up red when you pass your hand in front of it, and the Arduino should log "Motion detected!" to the console.

<!--Do I call it a console?--> 

###Why did this work?###
The first code block tells the Arduino what kind of input and output to expect from each pin number. The LED is pin 13. The PIR sensor is pin 2. The Arduino assumes that the level of infrared activity will be low. The code also creates a global variable in which to store the input value.

```
int ledPin = 13;                // choose the pin for the LED
int inputPin = 2;               // choose the input pin (for PIR sensor)
int pirState = LOW;             // we start, assuming no motion detected
int val = 0;                    // variable for reading the pin status
```

The second code block tells the Arduino what to expect as input and ouput:

<!--What does Serial.begin(9600); do?-->

```
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // declare LED as output
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // declare sensor as input
 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
```

The loop below is the action the Arduino takes. First, the Arduino reads the input from the passive infrared sensor. If the input is HIGH, 

<!--I need help understanding this loop. Shouldn't the Arduino print "Motion Detected" if the input changes from low to high, instead of high to low?-->

 


##STRETCH GOAL: Combine two sensors##

What if we just wanted to know what the temperature is when someone walks in the room? We can combine our temperature sensor and our PIR sensor. And we can merge the code. 



```
#include <dht.h>

dht DHT;


#define DHT22_PIN 5

int inputPin = 2;               // choose the input pin (for PIR sensor)
int pirState = LOW;             // we start, assuming no motion detected
int val = 0;                    // variable for reading the pin status
 
void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
    Serial.println("DHT TEST PROGRAM ");
    Serial.print("LIBRARY VERSION: ");
    Serial.println(DHT_LIB_VERSION);
    Serial.println();
    Serial.println("Type,\tstatus,\tHumidity (%),\tTemperature (C)");
    pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // declare sensor as input

}

void loop()
{
    val = digitalRead(inputPin);  // read input value
    if (val == HIGH) {            // check if the input is HIGH
    Serial.println("Motion detected!");

  // READ DATA
    Serial.print("DHT22, \t");
    int chk = DHT.read22(DHT22_PIN);
    switch (chk)
    {
        case DHTLIB_OK: 
            Serial.print("OK,\t"); 
            break;
        case DHTLIB_ERROR_CHECKSUM: 
            Serial.print("Checksum error,\t"); 
            break;
        case DHTLIB_ERROR_TIMEOUT: 
            Serial.print("Time out error,\t"); 
            break;
        default: 
            Serial.print("Unknown error,\t"); 
            break;
    }
    // DISPLAY DATA
    Serial.print(DHT.humidity, 1);
    Serial.print(",\t");
    Serial.println(DHT.temperature, 1);

    delay(5000);
    if (pirState == LOW) {
      // we have just turned on
      // We only want to print on the output change, not state
      pirState = HIGH;
    }
  } else {
    if (pirState == HIGH){
      // we have just turned of
      Serial.println("Motion ended!");
      // We only want to print on the output change, not state
      pirState = LOW;
    }
  }
}
```
