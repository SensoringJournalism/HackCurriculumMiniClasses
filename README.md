# Hack Curriculum Mini Classes
A repository of exercises for the ONA Hack Curriculum grant project from UNL, Texas State and USC.

Each excercise is intended to build on each other and will help build skills within a journalism school with regards to sensors and small electronics for journalism.

In this repository will be exercises covering blinking lights, passive infrared sensing, temperature and humidity, light and others.

These are the mini-courses planned for each sensor and platform. Progress will be noted with an X for which ones are done.
