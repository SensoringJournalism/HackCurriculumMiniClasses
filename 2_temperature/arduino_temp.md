# Checking the temperature

### Our first foray into inputs

The most basic and widespread sensor journalism in the world is the weather. And that starts with temperature. So given that, let's explore taking the temperature of the room you are in right now. 

## Arduino

To do this, we'll need to try a few new things. We'll first need to regulate the signal using a resistor -- and explore the concept of "noisy" signals. We'll need to take input -- instead of providing output -- to our board. And we'll need to use the monitor built into the Arduino software to see what the temperature is. 

We need a breadboard, so grab yours. Place it to the right of the Arduino. To do this, we'll also need a red and black jumper wire, a jumper wire with another color and an RHT03 temperature and humidity sensor.
