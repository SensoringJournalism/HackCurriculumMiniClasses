# Detecting light

### Sensing sunlight to determine when to do something

Often, we just want to sense things when the time is right. For solar powered applications, that'll be in daylight. For others, that might be time dependent. So for this exercise, we'll use light to change our Arduino from a low power state to an on state, do something, and then return to a low power state when the light goes out again.
